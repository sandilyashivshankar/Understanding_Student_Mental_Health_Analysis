# Student Mental Health Survey Analysis

This project performs an exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the "Mental Health Survey Dataset". The analysis is contained in a Jupyter Notebook (`Mental_Health_Analysis.ipynb`) and aims to uncover patterns and correlations between academic, social, and financial factors and students' self-reported mental health.

## Project Files

* **`Mental_Health_Analysis.ipynb`**: A Jupyter Notebook containing all the Python code for data loading, cleaning, analysis, and visualization.
* **`Mental_Health_Survey_Dataset.csv`**: The raw dataset in CSV format used for the analysis.

## Dataset

The `Mental_Health_Survey_Dataset.csv` file contains student responses. Based on the data, key columns include:
* `gender`
* `age`
* `university`

* `financial_concerns`
* `social_relationships`
* `depression`
* `anxiety`
* `isolation`
* `future_insecurity`
* `stress_relief_activities`
...and several others.
